 Open the parent directory in your command line / terminal and run <code>mysql -u root -p</code> (that is, if your mysql username was created as 'root').
 Enter your mysql password when prompted. 
 Open a new command line / terminal window cd to the parent directory again, run <code>npm i</code> 
 Back to the SQL terminal window run <code>USE company_db</code> to use the MySql database.
 Then run <code>SOURCE schema.sql;</code> to establish the tables within the database. 
 Then run <code>SOURCE seeds.sql;</code> to provide the company with some sample content. 
 
 If all of that sounds complicated, see the video below.
